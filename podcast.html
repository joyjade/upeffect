            “These episodes were very interesting to me, especially as I had only a slight acquaintance with Islamic economics. Dr. Nasser did an excellent job of contrasting the traditional teachings with today's wildly out of balance economy. I will be looking for future episodes and am learning a lot.”

            “I’m really appreciating Re-Envision Business. It’s exciting that this is out there. My exposure may not be the widest, but this show is unlike anything else I’m aware of in alternative-economy media. Have begun recommending it, particularly to connections in the UK.”

            “There couldn’t be a more pertinent time for a podcast exploring the intersection of business and social impact, and this series serves as a great dive into some of the complex intertwined issues in this area. A consummate, thoughtful host in Sheeza and pioneering guests - I’m looking forward to more episodes as they’re released.”
