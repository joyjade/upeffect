          <p>
            Founders invest substantial time and capital into building and marketing their brands. Raising capital is 
            an uphill battle when you’re trying to build a company and adding on the stress of reporting to investors, 
            multiplying their financial returns or paying back an increasing interest on loans is the last thing that 
            you need. Healthy sales and revenue is the foundation of every successful business so why not pool your resources 
            to build demand for your product?

            UpEffect has certainly surpassed my expectation for a crowdfunding platform. The team is very supportive and available 24x7, always on their toes, solving issues faster than you can raise them. There are so many social problems in the world, many problem solvers and so many people who are willing to support. Something like UpEffect is so much needed. Many more crowdfunding campaigns to come from me.

            <p class="question">
              Should I crowdfund before raising investment?
              <span class="plus"></span>
            </p>
            <p class="answer ">
              Getting feedback from customers is a key component to building a successful product and company. 
              Crowdfunding is an inexpensive way of reaching thousands of potential customers and finding out what 
              they think. Most new businesses depend on some form of marketing to reach customers, with crowdfunding, 
              you're able to create urgency around a funding goal. With this approach, you're able to test demand
              for your idea prior to investing in manufacturing, inventory, hiring staff, building a website or 
              other expenses. This allows you to focus on revenue, retain ownership and build your business on your 
              own terms which makes your venture more attractive to investors if that is what you're after. Investment
              has its place in business but we believe having a successful crowdfunding campaign under your belt means 
              you're able to steer the ship in a direction that is on your terms.

            <p class="question">What type of crowdfunding does UpEffect offer?<span class="plus"></span></p>
            <p class="answer ">
              We're a rewards-based crowdfunding platform. We encourage creators to offer tangible goods and services as
              incentives to backers in exchange for their financial support. Our creators typically create pre-order 
              campaigns to build demand for products and/or services.

          <div class="qa">
            <p class="question">How is UpEffect different to Kickstarter or Indiegogo?<span class="plus"></span></p>
            <p class="answer ">
              UpEffect was founded to eliminate the biggest problems plaguing the crowdfunding industry: low success rates and harmful products. Campaigns on most crowdfunding platforms suffer from limited curation, lack of personalised support and are mass-market focused which is why over 60% of campaigns fail. Furthermore, most platforms do not hold their campaigns or creators to any ethical standards. 9% of Kickstarter campaigns have failed to deliver a single reward to supporters, essentially pocketing the crowdfunded money.
  
              In stark contrast, UpEffect’s enterprise solution approach and campaign consultant model drives our 95% success rate, the highest in the crowdfunding industry. Instead of simply providing another platform for campaigns to raise money without any help, we employ industry best practices to ensure founders are creating exceptional campaign pages and building a “crowd” to back their projects. In essence, UpEffect allows smaller fish that get neglected on larger platforms to convert their powerful ideas into successful campaigns, not only to meet a funding target but also to successfully launch a product to a loyal customer base.
  
              We understand if you're after a "big" crowdfunding platform. That's not us. We're not on a mission to build a hyper growth business or a unicorn. For us, our creators and backers come first and we have a vested interest in making this business succeed. The two founders are also UpEffect's only shareholders. We have no investors and intend to keep it this way. By building a profitable business and focusing on growing the team who have ownership in the business, we're able to dedicate our time and resources to what is most important to us: supporting socially responsible businesses raise capital to build a better world. We move slowly and modestly at UpEffect; this allows us to test, iterate, improve and create services that cater to the evolving needs of our creators. This also allows us to learn and become students of the process.
  
              We believe this puts us in a strong position to equip our founders with the right tools, funding and knowledge to solve global poverty, illiteracy, social injustice, climate change and more.

            <p class="answer ">
              If you are tired of pitching for funding, struggling to navigate crowdfunding, in need of structure and discipline or unsure how to build a profitable business without investment, we're the right platform for you. We're dedicated to improving access to funding for founders bettering our world; this means creating opportunities and removing barriers to entry, in particular ones placed by banks, investors and other crowdfunding platforms that frequently overlook founders of colour, social entrepreneurs and female founders. More details on our criteria can be found here but we encourage you to apply if you're unsure.

              All payments are processed by Stripe and their fee is 1.9% + 20p per transaction for European cards and 2.9% + 20p per transaction for non-European cards.

              For £199, you get 30-days of personalised campaign support. If you find value in our service, we encourage you to opt for additional months of support while you're preparing for your campaign launch. We don't automatically charge creators for additional months; you're only charged for the first 30 days and we will ask you how you wish to proceed once this period is complete. You are, however, contractually bound to run your campaign on UpEffect before leaving for another crowdfunding platform. We pour our heart and soul into helping our creators succeed and we believe it's only fair we share in your success if you decide to crowdfund.

            <p class="answer ">
              To create a sense of urgency around the live campaign, we implement an all-or-nothing model, which helps set targets and also offer protection to backers so that campaign creators are only able to collect their funds once they have met their minimum funding goal. This means that entrepreneurs are continuously motivated to ensure they succeed. This is also a good way of building credibility as backers are more comfortable supporting an idea that they know campaign creators are serious about making a reality.

            <p class="answer ">
              No, sorry! We believe creators should be at the forefront of building genuine and direct relationships with their audience and no agency or third party will be able to do justice to this. Our £199 fee covers the cost of our Creator Toolkit which includes resources, calculators, planners, accountability check-ins, coaching sessions and reviewing your content. The goal of the Creator plan is to equip you with tools so that you can architect a loyal community and reach 100% of your funding goal. Our 5% success fee covers the cost of our platform, technology and support.

            <p class="answer ">
              This depends on your funding goal but we recommend a minimum of two months. Our Funding Goal Calculator will help you determine what the right goal is for your campaign and based on that, we can advise on the right timeframe. You are only required to sign up for one month of the Creator plan with UpEffect.

            <p class="question">What is the minimum or maximum I can raise?<span class="plus"></span></p>
            <p class="answer ">
              The minimum is £1,000. There is no maximum, however, we recommend setting realistic goals that you can explain to your community of backers. We also suggest calculating how much capital you need to build a profitable business in the next 18 months and using that as your guideline to determine your funding goal. Our Rewards and Funding Goal Calculators available as part of our Creator Toolkit will help you with this.
