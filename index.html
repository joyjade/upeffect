          <p>
            Banks perceive social entrepreneurs, BAME, those with disabilities, immigrants, female founders, and those with limited credit histories as high risk. 
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2018, only 2% of venture capital went to female founders and less than 0.2% went to founders of colour (Diversity VC). And business loan approval 
            rates for women are 15-20% lower than men.

          <p>
            Founders invest substantial time and capital into building and marketing their brands. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Crowdfunding can propel these efforts through the act of raising small amounts of money from a large group of people 
            in exchange for goods and services. This helps founders access customers, funds and partners who join early and become 
            invested in the success of the brand.

          <h6>64% of crowdfunding campaigns fail.</h6>
          <p>
            Mainstream crowdfunding platforms are venture-backed. They are built to serve those with existing capital, networks 
            and expertise. Overlooked founders often don’t have access to these resources and are left to fend for themselves 
            while competing with thousands of live campaigns.

            We equip and empower creators with the tools to navigate crowdfunding. Many years of research and working directly 
            with founders has driven our design process and in response, we’ve created a comprehensive campaign playbook made 
            of campaign management planners, templates, workflows and calculators. We also offer coaching calls, feedback on 
            materials, accountability check-ins and more to support creators with creating a successful crowdfunding campaign.
